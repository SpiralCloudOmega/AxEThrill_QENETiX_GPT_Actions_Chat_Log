## Problem Description

Having issues with the GPT Action not connecting to the external API endpoint.

## Conversation Log

**User**: My GPT Action is failing to connect to my API. It keeps returning a 401 error.

**Assistant**: A 401 error typically indicates an authentication issue. Let's troubleshoot this step by step:

1. **Check your API key**: Make sure the API key in your action configuration is correct and hasn't expired.

2. **Verify authentication method**: Ensure you're using the correct authentication method (Bearer token, API key in header, etc.).

3. **Check API endpoint**: Verify that the endpoint URL is correct and accessible.

**User**: I double-checked the API key and it looks correct. The authentication is set to Bearer token.

**Assistant**: Let's try these additional steps:

1. Test your API endpoint directly using a tool like curl or Postman to ensure it's working
2. Check if there are any IP whitelist restrictions on your API
3. Verify that the Content-Type header is set correctly in your OpenAPI spec

**User**: I tested with curl and it works fine. Let me check the OpenAPI spec...

**Assistant**: Good! Since curl works, the issue is likely in the OpenAPI specification. Common issues include:
- Missing or incorrect `securitySchemes` definition
- Wrong parameter names or locations
- Incorrect content-type specifications

**User**: Found it! I had a typo in the security scheme name. Fixed it and now it works perfectly.

**Assistant**: Excellent! Typos in security scheme names are a common gotcha. For future reference, always ensure the security scheme name in your `securitySchemes` section exactly matches what you reference in your operation's `security` array.

## Resolution

Issue resolved by fixing typo in the OpenAPI security scheme name.
